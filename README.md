# Automated Classification of Leukocytes for Blood Disease Diagnosis Using Deep CNN  

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automated classification of leukocytes (white blood cells) to aid in the diagnosis of blood-related diseases such as Leukemia, Myeloma, and AIDS. Traditional methods for white blood cell evaluation are time-intensive, prone to errors, and may fail to detect morphological abnormalities. Our approach leverages Deep CNNs to analyze blood sample images, accurately classifying Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Eosinophils, and Monocytes.  

## Key Features  
- **Dataset**: 410 original blood cell images and 12,500 augmented images.  
- **Model Performance**: Achieved improved classification accuracy and reduced error rates compared to traditional methods.  
- **Techniques**: Deep CNN for feature extraction, data augmentation for dataset expansion, and robust image classification.
